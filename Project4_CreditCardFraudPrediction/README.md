#### Project 4: Credit Card Fraud Prediction

In the year 2018, a total of $24.26 Billion was lost due to payment card fraud across the globe, and United States is the most fraud-prone country.
Financial institutions like Visa, MasterCard, Discover, and all debit networks have mandated that banks and merchants introduce EMV card technology to counter the fraud. 
There can be two kinds of card fraud, card-present fraud, and card-not-present fraud. Card, not present fraud is almost 81 percent more likely than point-of-sale fraud. 

We used Machine learning algorithms to predict if credit card transaction is fraudulent or non-fraudulent.
* Train the data with 75% of the dataset and test with the remaining 25% of the dataset.
* SMOTE oversampling technique helped overcome the Imbalanced datasets challenge. 
* Based on a comparison of the confusion matrix of classification models, we recommend that Random Forest classification would be a better performing model to predict whether a transaction is fraudulent or not.
