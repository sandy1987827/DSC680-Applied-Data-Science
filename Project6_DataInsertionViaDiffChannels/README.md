#### Project 6: 

This project is about inserting the data of breweries located in United States of America with all the details like address, what type of brewery and online website link.
* All the data sets have a common column name (name of the brewery) which links them together.
* Milestones needs data be cleansed extracted from all the sources and then data has to be inserted into a database and also can be used to visualize.
  * Dataset from flat file is having all the information and needs to be checked for duplicates and some bad data. 
  * Data from API source needs to extracted and converted into a readable csv format for the states that we need 
  * Data from Wikipedia source is not in a proper format, we have to extract that as a tabular format and also needs some additional columns to be added like the address details, those were provided as a hyperlink which I think has to be handled manually.
* Once all the above steps are done, I feel data sets will be ready to be inserted into Database
