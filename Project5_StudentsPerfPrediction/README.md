#### Project 5: Students Performance Prediction

This case study is to predict the how the students performance which is the target variable based on the dependent variables of the marks they achieved in some subjects

* Logistic regression is one of the most fundamental and widely used Machine Learning Algorithm. A logistic regression in its plain form is used to model relationship between one or more predictor variables to a binary categorical target variable. The target variable is marked as 1 and 0.
* To build a simple logistic regression model for prediction of performance of the students given the values about their individuals scores they achieved based on which whether an entity can admit the student into their organization or not. 
* Current model predicts that the scores are significant variables that decide the outcome of the students performance whether he/she passes or not. Also the accuracy of the model was 93.67% which implies a very good model with the data that we have at hand. To conclude higher the individual scores in each subject would increase the chance of passing in the semester. I can recommend this model to an educational institution whether to admit the student into their organization based on the marks they achieve.
